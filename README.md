# Project-CRV2

**Project-CRV2** is a chatbot-powered query system for analyzing a dataset of business contacts. It leverages OpenAI embeddings, Pinecone for vector similarity search, and a streamlined Python workflow for efficient data querying.

---

## **Features**
- **Query Contact Database**: Run advanced queries such as "How many senior decision-makers are in manufacturing companies in Hampshire?"
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses `text-embedding-ada-002` for generating embeddings.
- **Vector Search**: Powered by Pinecone to retrieve relevant results based on embeddings.
- **Streamlined Codebase**: Well-organized Python scripts for generating embeddings, uploading them to Pinecone, and querying results.
- **GitHub Integration**: Easily manage and share project code.

---

## **Setup**

### **Requirements**
- Python 3.12+
- Virtual Environment (`venv`)
- Installed libraries:
  - `openai`
  - `pinecone-client`
  - `pandas`

---

### **Installation**
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Project-CRV2.git
   cd Project-CRV2
Set up the virtual environment:

For Windows:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
For macOS/Linux:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install openai pinecone-client pandas
Configure API Keys:

Create a .env file in the root of your project directory with the following content:
makefile
Copy code
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
Usage
1. Generate Embeddings
Run the script to generate embeddings for the dataset:

bash
Copy code
python generate_embeddings.py
2. Upload Embeddings to Pinecone
After generating embeddings, upload them to the Pinecone index:

bash
Copy code
python upload_embeddings.py
3. Query the Dataset
Query the dataset using a specific question, such as:

bash
Copy code
python query_count.py
Edit the query in query_count.py to customize your search.

Files in the Project
File	Description
generate_embeddings.py	Generates embeddings for the dataset using OpenAI's text-embedding model.
upload_embeddings.py	Uploads the generated embeddings to the Pinecone index.
query_count.py	Runs queries on the Pinecone index to retrieve relevant records.
grouped_data_with_embeddings.csv	Example dataset with pre-generated embeddings.
.env	Stores API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone. Ensure this file is created locally.
Future Improvements
Support for advanced natural language queries.
Enhanced chatbot interface for better user interaction.
